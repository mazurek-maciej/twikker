### What can be change / improved?

It depends 😊

I don't enjoy handling state locally which is cause to code become small junk.

So, probably if application will be expanded then some state manager will be on plus, like Redux e.g.

Also better composition of components and probably handling API calls. And of course more tests to find some possible corner cases 😊
